- implement decentralized backend (firebase temporary)
  - write smart contract
  - test contract
  - connect front and back ends
  - test user auth
- add ERC-721 (NFT battle pass)

## Game Modes
---
### 1v1 Ranked Ladder (Beginner - Intermediate Leagues)
* *Underhand Serves Only* 
* First to 11 or 21 (losing player at 11 decides to go to 21 or take the loss)
* Only score on your serve (which will be purposely designed to be disadvantageous - as opposed to tennis, where people on serve have the advantage)
* Rally for serve (2 serves each)
* Player1 serves to Player2 in diagonal service box 
* Player2 receives serve and must hit ball past opponent's service box, otherwise Player1 earns 1 point
---
### 1v1 Ranked Ladder (Advanced Leagues) -> TBD
* *Overhead Serves Allowed*

---
### King of the Court (3+ players)
* 2 or more players (no upper limit, game will take longer with more players)
* First to 11 or 21 (if 1v1 - losing player at 11 decides to go to 21 or take the loss)
* King goes to whoever wins first point 
* Challengers will have to win 2 points to beat current King (Challengers serve first, King serves on second point)
* Points can be earned in 2 ways:
  1. Become King: first point = first blood bonus point
  2. Win points as King

**How paywalled would you say recreational tennis is for adults in New York City?**

It depends a lot on what “recreational tennis” means (how often, what level of facility, whether indoors/privately run vs public parks, lessons, etc.). But on balance I’d say it’s moderately paywalled in NYC — there are low-cost and even “free-ish” options, but many of the better ones come at a nontrivial cost and there are logistical and time barriers. I’ll break down what I found to give you a clearer picture.

How “paywalled” is it — i.e. what are the barriers?

From what I saw, the barriers are less about an absolute “can’t do it without spending a lot” and more about time, convenience, and premium quality. Some of the barriers:

* Permit requirement: To use outdoor courts in many parks during tennis season, you need a permit. That’s $100/year, which isn’t huge but is a hurdle for very casual players. 

* Reservation vs walk-on access: Many courts require reservations (especially at prime spots) or have limited slots. If you want the convenience of reserving ahead at a popular court or during prime hours, you often pay reservation fees. 

* Seasonality: Outdoor courts are seasonal (spring-to-fall), so for much of the year, options shrink unless you go indoor (which costs more). 

* Time constraints: Popular courts fill quickly, especially in good weather, evenings, weekends. So even with “cheap” public courts, there’s sometimes the cost in time (arrive early, wait) or having to settle for less desirable times/locations.

* Quality / amenities: If you want nicer courts, lighting, indoor access (winter), coaching, etc., that tends to push you into private clubs or paid premium courts which are significantly more expensive.

Bottom line: how paywalled?

Putting it all together, I’d rate it as moderately restrictive but not extremely so — there are accessible paths to playing frequently without huge cost, especially if you accept outdoor courts, odd hours, and some flexibility. But if you want high quality, indoor, easy reservable courts, or coaching, then yes, it becomes fairly paywalled.

If you were to put it on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = basically completely free / very easy access; 10 = almost totally restricted & expensive), I’d say recreational tennis for adults in NYC is around 6 or 7. Good options exist, but real cost or effort kicks in once you want convenience or premium experience.

NYC recreational tennis is heavily paywalled, especially for intermediate adults who want consistent, level-appropriate matches without breaking the bank.

Let’s unpack why:

🎾 1. Finding players at your level is the biggest hidden barrier

Even though there are tons of players in NYC, the ecosystem is fragmented:

Public courts don’t have built-in matchmaking. You can show up with a permit, but you need to find opponents yourself — either through word of mouth, Meetup groups, or apps like Kourts, TennisPAL, or Break the Love.

Most “open play” meetups or community ladders are either flooded with beginners or thinly populated at the intermediate level (3.5–4.5 NTRP).

The few good ladders or rating-based leagues (like USTA, NY Tennis Meetup leagues, or FlexLeagues) typically cost $50–$100 per season plus you still need to pay for court time.

So, unless you already have a network of regular partners, you often end up paying to access other players.

💸 2. Court fees and permits stack up quickly

Even at “public” rates, NYC tennis adds up fast:

Outdoor season permit = $100/year

Indoor court time (winter) = $40–$80/hour (per court, often split between two players, so $20–$40 each)

Reservation fees at nicer outdoor sites = ~$15/hour

Single-play permit = $15/time slot

For context, in many other U.S. cities, you can rally or book public courts for free or just a few bucks. NYC is closer to London or Tokyo levels of access friction — lots of demand, limited space, and gatekeeping via permits or fees.

🧩 3. Community and league options are there — but monetized

There are community ladders and league options:

USTA Leagues: ~$60/season + court fees

Gotham Tennis / Tennis World NYC / Break the Love leagues: $100–$200+ for 4–6 matches

Flex Leagues (like TennisNYC): ~$50–$75 per ladder season

All these are basically paid solutions for what should be free social matching — i.e., meeting evenly matched players and playing outdoors.

That’s why intermediate players often get stuck between:

Beginners (too easy, not fun), and

Clubs/leagues (too expensive, too structured).

🏙️ 4. Indoor season is where the paywall spikes

Once the fall hits, almost every affordable option disappears.

Private clubs and bubbles dominate winter tennis.

Even public “bubbles” (e.g., at Central Park or Prospect Park) become privatized — $80/hour is standard.

Without a club membership or an organized league, casual hitting basically stops until spring unless you pay those rates.

So, winter doubles the paywall.

⚖️ 5. Overall reality check

If we define “recreational access for intermediates” as:

“Find people around your level, play once or twice a week year-round, without breaking the bank.”

Then NYC’s current model is about 8.5/10 paywalled.
You can do it cheaply if you hustle hard (network, coordinate, accept off-peak hours), but the system incentivizes money over organic community.

🧠 Why this matters (and how your LeagueMatch idea fits)

What you’re describing — the frustration of wanting competitive matches without club fees — is exactly the gap that LeagueMatch and your SPIN algorithm could fix:

Level-based matchmaking for public-court players

Crypto or token-based incentives instead of fixed league fees

Rewarding players for hosting matches and providing court access

Turning the city into a decentralized tennis network

In other words: make NYC tennis “free to play” again — the way pickup basketball already is.

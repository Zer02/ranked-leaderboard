## Game Modes
---
### 1v1 Ranked Ladder (Beginner - Intermediate Leagues)
* *Underhand Serves Only* 
* First to 11 or 21 (losing player at 11 decides to go to 21 or take the loss)
* Only score on your serve (which will be purposely designed to be disadvantageous - as opposed to tennis, where people on serve have the advantage)
* Rally for serve (2 serves each)
* Player1 serves to Player2 in diagonal service box 
* Player2 receives serve and must hit ball past opponent's service box, otherwise Player1 earns 1 point
---
### 1v1 Ranked Ladder (Advanced Leagues) -> TBD
* *Overhead Serves Allowed*

---
### King of the Court (3+ players)
* 2 or more players (no upper limit, game will take longer with more players)
* First to 11 or 21 (if 1v1 - losing player at 11 decides to go to 21 or take the loss)
* King goes to whoever wins first point 
* Challengers will have to win 2 points to beat current King (Challengers serve first, King serves on second point)
* Points can be earned in 2 ways:
  1. Become King: first point = first blood bonus point
  2. Win points as King

## Game Modes
---
### 1v1 Ranked Ladder (Beginner - Intermediate Leagues)
* *Underhand Serves Only* 
* First to 11 or 21 (losing player at 11 decides to go to 21 or take the loss)
* Only score on your serve (which will be purposely designed to be disadvantageous - as opposed to tennis, where people on serve have the advantage)
* Rally for serve (2 serves each)
* Player1 serves to Player2 in diagonal service box 
* Player2 receives serve and must hit ball past opponent's service box, otherwise Player1 earns 1 point
---
### 1v1 Ranked Ladder (Advanced Leagues) -> TBD
* *Overhead Serves Allowed*

---
### King of the Court (3+ players)
* 2 or more players (no upper limit, game will take longer with more players)
* First to 11 or 21 (if 1v1 - losing player at 11 decides to go to 21 or take the loss)
* King goes to whoever wins first point 
* Challengers will have to win 2 points to beat current King (Challengers serve first, King serves on second point)
* Points can be earned in 2 ways:
  1. Become King: first point = first blood bonus point
  2. Win points as King

**How paywalled would you say recreational tennis is for adults in New York City?**

It depends a lot on what “recreational tennis” means (how often, what level of facility, whether indoors/privately run vs public parks, lessons, etc.). But on balance I’d say it’s moderately paywalled in NYC — there are low-cost and even “free-ish” options, but many of the better ones come at a nontrivial cost and there are logistical and time barriers. I’ll break down what I found to give you a clearer picture.

How “paywalled” is it — i.e. what are the barriers?

From what I saw, the barriers are less about an absolute “can’t do it without spending a lot” and more about time, convenience, and premium quality. Some of the barriers:

* Permit requirement: To use outdoor courts in many parks during tennis season, you need a permit. That’s $100/year, which isn’t huge but is a hurdle for very casual players. 

* Reservation vs walk-on access: Many courts require reservations (especially at prime spots) or have limited slots. If you want the convenience of reserving ahead at a popular court or during prime hours, you often pay reservation fees. 

* Seasonality: Outdoor courts are seasonal (spring-to-fall), so for much of the year, options shrink unless you go indoor (which costs more). 

* Time constraints: Popular courts fill quickly, especially in good weather, evenings, weekends. So even with “cheap” public courts, there’s sometimes the cost in time (arrive early, wait) or having to settle for less desirable times/locations.

* Quality / amenities: If you want nicer courts, lighting, indoor access (winter), coaching, etc., that tends to push you into private clubs or paid premium courts which are significantly more expensive.

Bottom line: how paywalled?

Putting it all together, I’d rate it as moderately restrictive but not extremely so — there are accessible paths to playing frequently without huge cost, especially if you accept outdoor courts, odd hours, and some flexibility. But if you want high quality, indoor, easy reservable courts, or coaching, then yes, it becomes fairly paywalled.

If you were to put it on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = basically completely free / very easy access; 10 = almost totally restricted & expensive), I’d say recreational tennis for adults in NYC is around 6 or 7. Good options exist, but real cost or effort kicks in once you want convenience or premium experience.
